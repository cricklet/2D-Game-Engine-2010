h1. 2D-Game-Engine-2011

This is a game engine I wrote in 2010. It's designed to be as flexible as possible and allow simple, quick creation of new games.

GameEngine is the base engine. GravityEngine, PlatformerEngine, and RTSEngine all use the classes found within Game Engine. Plumber of the Living Dead, GravityGame, and ZombieRTS are all proof-of-concept games which show the GameEngine's capabilities.

Design Principles:
 * Entities (w/o components): I didn't learn about using components to allow for pseudo-multiple-inheritance until after building this engine.
 * Inheritance: GameEngine->RTSEngine->ZombieRTS.
 * Global Events: any entity can send global events. These events can either be picked up by the game thread or by other entities. This is the main method of communication inside the game. I designed the game this way so entities wouldn't have to directly access functions in other entities.
